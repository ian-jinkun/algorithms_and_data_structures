    "Giving and receiving feedback also make me pay more attention to marginal situations, code readability, and how to clearly explain my thought process. I really appreciate the similarities between the review process and real-world code reviews - collaboration and focus on improvement. Overall, this assignment has made me more confident in solving algorithm problems and communicating technical solutions with colleagues."
